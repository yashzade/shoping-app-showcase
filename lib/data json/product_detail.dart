      '''Capsicums are delightfully colored fruits offered in red, green and yellow colors. They are mild-flavored and used as vegetables. Capsaicin is a tasteless, unscented chemical concentrated in the veins of chillies and peppers.
Capsicum is rich in numerous phytonutrients mainly antioxidants, dietary fiber and minerals like potassium, copper, manganese and magnesium. It attaches a dynamic personality to your food owing to vibrant colors of green, yellow, and red and even orange. It combines into any dish and brings out a convinced zing and flavor.'''
